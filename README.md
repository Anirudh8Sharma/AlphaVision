Welcome to the Alpha Vision MVP Repository!


## Project Overview

You are currently viewing the repository for the Alpha Vision MVP, developed by Data Science Solution Company (DSSC). As a Data Scientist at DSSC, our team's mission is to collaborate with clients, understand their unique needs, and provide tailored data science solutions across various domains, including healthcare, finance, and business. The Alpha Vision project represents a significant opportunity as we partner with Financial Consultation (FC), a major financial company in Toronto, to integrate AI/ML capabilities into their services.

## About Financial Consultation (FC)

Financial Consultation (FC) is a prominent financial institution based in Toronto, specializing in offering comprehensive financial consultations to clients seeking to make informed decisions in the stock market. Recognizing the competitive landscape, FC has embarked on a journey to incorporate AI/ML technologies into their portfolio to deliver AI-backed financial advice to their clientele.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of the Alpha Vision MVP is to showcase DSSC's expertise in data science. Specifically, we aim to demonstrate our capabilities by developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that encompasses the following core components:

1. **Data Collection:** We will implement data collection mechanisms, including APIs, to gather financial data from relevant sources.

2. **Data Storage:** The collected data will be efficiently stored in appropriate data sources, which may include both relational and non-relational databases or object storage solutions such as AWS S3.

3. **Data Loading:** We will load and process the collected data from the chosen data source, preparing it for analysis.

4. **Data Manipulation:** Our team will address missing values, data errors, and anomalies to ensure the quality and integrity of the data.

5. **Data Exploration:** Utilizing data exploration techniques, including data visualization, we will uncover valuable insights within the data.

6. **Visualization:** We will create informative and visually appealing data visualizations to facilitate better data understanding.

7. **AI/ML Analysis:** Applying state-of-the-art AI/ML models and statistical analysis, we aim to provide FC with actionable insights and recommendations.

8. **Project Report:** To conclude the MVP, we will compile a comprehensive report summarizing the project's findings, analysis results, and all relevant details.

## Project Management

To efficiently manage and collaborate on this project, we will utilize the following tools and platforms:

- **Task Management:** Our project tasks and milestones will be tracked and managed using Trello (https://trello.com/).

- **Source Code Management:** This GitHub repository will serve as our central platform for source code management, version control, and team collaboration.

## Project Timeline

The Alpha Vision MVP development will span several weeks, with each week dedicated to delivering specific project components. This iterative approach ensures that we maintain a high level of quality and precision throughout the project.

We are excited to embark on this journey with Financial Consultation, and we look forward to delivering a cutting-edge AI/ML solution that will enhance their financial consultation services.
